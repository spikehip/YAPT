YAPT is a period tracker that does not harvest your phone identity, your location, does not want to make an internet connection, all it does is it nags you every single day to answer a simple question: Are you having your period that day? All you need to do is putting its widget on your desktop. So you will hopefully not forget to take your pills or just will remember when your last one ended. Hope this helps you to calm down and not rush to the drug store for a baby test. Or the opposite :) Have fun!
